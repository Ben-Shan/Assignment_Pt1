My assignment, upon competition, consists of a main menu, and 3 unique graphs, using the dataset of averaged mountain deaths on each mountain over the past 10 years.
The main menu consists of a few instructions and 3 green rings, one of which is ‘selected’, seen as holding a green ball within its ring. Using the spacebar the user can move between the 3 options, when a ring is selected the name of the graph it represents shows at the bottom.

Line Graph:
The first graph displays the data as a line graph (or mountain range, if you’re hopeful and squint your eyes sort of…) with the mountain names along the x-axis and the number of deaths along the y-axis.

Radar Graph:
The second graph displays the data in an unusual way, in a radar. The mountains have being divided up into segments of the radar and as the line moves around radar it ‘detects’ the mountain and gives off a ‘beep’, the beep angle represents the mountain, which appears briefly in the bottom right hand corner while the number of deaths on the mountain is determined by how close the beep is to the centre of the radar circle, with the centre being zero. There is a scale in the South-East region of the radar. The mountains will repeat at 0 degrees on the radar.

Mountain Range Graph:
The final graph in shown as a mountain range, as if the user is looking side on at the mountain, the mountains go in a random loop displaying the name and the number of deaths on that mountain on screen. As well as this it draws a mountain on screen with the height depending on how many people died on that mountain (smaller mountains have less deaths etc.). To allow the user to view each mountain with appropriate time the frame rate of the function is lowered to ‘1’, this messes with the return function, (so some button mashing is required…).

‘The greatest Secrets are hidden in the most unlikely places’- Roald Dahl
Unfortunately for Roald Dahl my secret isn’t all too hidden, or a secret… it’s a simple gui control which is constantly on screen, im just not going to tell you what it does!

Hope you enjoy!
