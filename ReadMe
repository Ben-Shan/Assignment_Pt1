Object Orientated Programming Assignment Pt 1:

DT282- C14347291- Ben Shanahan

The Dataset I have chosen represents the number of deaths that have occurred in the last 10 years on the ‘Eight Thousanders’, 
A group of 14 mountains in the Himalayan district which all exceed 8000 metres high.
(My dataset contains 13 mountains, excluding Mt. Everest).
I chose this dataset as I have a strong interest in the Himalayas along with the mountains that are found there. 
(Hopefully will be going hiking there this summer. Fingers crossed!) 
I have less of an interest in the number of deaths that have occurred in the region, 
however this dataset was the only one I could find, regarding the Himalayas.

My plans for using this dataset are as follows: 
When ran the program will display a line graph, with ‘Number of Deaths’ along the y-axis and the names of the Mountains 
along the x-axis. (The Number of deaths will be the total that occurred on the mountain over the past 10 years.) 
The line graph will ideally look like a mountain range with peaks and valleys along the x-axis. 
To help the visualization I well use colours and possibly visuals to make the ‘mountain range’ look more realistic.
I may even add a snow fall animation on screen! 
For my second visualization I am less sure, however if I can get it working,
I would like to make it look like a birds eye view of a map, with all the different mountains represented as triangles, 
or some such like, with the names underneath and the number of deaths either inside each triangle or 
listed along the side of the screen.

Sorry for the essay, get carried away sometimes! Look forward to show you my completed project!
